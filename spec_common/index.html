        Imperative Terms In Specifications
      </h1>
      <p>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document, and all other documents that comprise the specification of The Platform RESTful API, are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" (RFC 2119).
      </p>
      <h1>
        <a name="Transport_Protocol"></a>
        Transport Protocol
      </h1>
      <p>
        All of The Platform APIs are based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, version 1.1 (RFC 2616).  Each request will be authenticated using HTTP Basic Authentication (RFC 2617).  Therefore, requests sent from clients on the public Internet (and not on a secure channel such as a VPN)
        <b>
          MUST
        </b>
        use the
        <i>
          https
        </i>
        protocol.
      </p>
      <h1>
        <a name="URI_Space"></a>
        URI Space
      </h1>
      <p>
        The resources in the system are Spaces, Virtual Data Centers (VDCs), Virtual Machines (VMs), VM Templates, and Networks.  All are identified by URIs.   To begin operations, a client must know the URI for a Space.  Dereferencing it will yield a representation of the space containing links to the VDCs, Templates, and Networks in that space.  Similarly, dereferencing a VDC will yield a representation that identifies the VMs in the VDC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients MUST NOT make assumptions about the layout of the URIs within a Space.
      </p>
      <h1>
        <a name="Media_Types"></a>
        Media Types
      </h1>
      <p>
        In The Platform API, resource representations and request bodies are normally encoded in JSON, as specified in RFC4267.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each type of resource has its own media-type, which matches the pattern
        <i>
          application/vnd.com.sun.cloud.xxxxx+json
        </i>
        , where "xxxxx" represents the portion of the identifier unique to a particular representation format for each service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Platform
        <b>
          MUST
        </b>
        provide representations of all resources available in JSON.  The Platform
        <b>
          MAY
        </b>
        also provide resource represenations in HTML when interacting with a human-oriented User-Agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Platform
        <b>
          MUST
        </b>
        accept requests from clients encoded in JSON.  The Platform
        <b>
          MAY
        </b>
        also accept
        <i>
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        </i>
        (i.e. simple HTML forms) for request entities that only need simple name/value pairs.

        Successful requests will generally return an HTTP status code of 200 (OK), 201 (Created), or 204 (No Content), to indicate that the requested action has been successfully performed.  In addition, they might include a response message body (with an appropriate media type) containing a representation of the requested information.  However, it is possible for a number of things to go wrong.  The various underlying causes are described (as discussed in the previous section) by various HTTP status codes in the range 400-499 (for client side errors) or 500-599 (for server side problems).  The description of each request type
        <b>
          SHOULD

        list the possible status codes returned by that request type.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a response is returned with an error status code (400-499 or 500-599), the server
        <b>
          SHOULD
        </b>
        also return a response message body containing a

        <i>
          message
        </i>
        data models, describing what went wrong.  The text values of such messages might be used, for example, to communicate with a human user of the client side application.
