        This section specifies the representations of the resources which this API operates on.  The representations are made up of
        <b>
          fields
        </b>
        , each with a name and value, encoded using a JSON dictionary.  The values may be numeric or string literals, lists, or dictionaries, each of which are represented in the obvious way in JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
        These representations typically nest.  For example, the representation of a VDC will include representations of the Clusters which inhabit it, which in turn include representations of the VMs within each cluster.  Two points follow from this:
      </p>
      <ul>
<li>
          Retrieving the representation of a VDC gives a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of everything in it using a single GET request.  The size of these representations seems, in practice, not excessive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many of the models specify that the representation includes a
          <b>
            uri
          </b>
          field whose value is the URI of the resource being represented.  This is present to support URI discovery in nested representations.
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>
        Each type of cloud resource has its own Internet Media Type.  The media type
        <b>
          SHALL
        </b>
        conform to the pattern
        <i>
          application/vnd.com.sun.cloud.Xxxxxxxx+json
        </i>
        , and the specific media type for each resource model is included in square brackets in the corresponding section header.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the resource model descriptions, fields annotated with
        <b>
          [POST]
        </b>
        may be included in a POST request, which is normally used to create new resources.  Likewise, fields annotated with
        <b>
          [PUT]
        </b>
        may be included in a PUT request, which is normally used to update properties of existing resources.  Fields not so annotated
        <b>
          SHOULD NOT
        </b>
        be included in the request body of PUT and POST requests, and will be ignored by the server if they are included.

        Some of the "control" URIs, such as those identified in the "attach" and "detach" fields, are in principle always accessible and thus appear as first-class values in the representation of a VM.  Others may or may not be accessible based on the state of the VM, and may not appear in representations of it when not accessible. For convenience, these are grouped into the "controllers" list field, in which zero or more of the following URIs (keyed by the change type) will be included in a representation provided by the server.
